Aww man you sold your soul
Naww man mad people was frontin
Aww man made somethin from nothin
Picture workin so hard and you cant cut through
That can mess up your whole life like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to Im from the
Where cops dont come through and dreams dont come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From workin McDonalds barely payin the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
killings in a weekend killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
In Jesus name let the choir say
Im on fire ay thats what Richard Pryor say
And well annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know they admire Ye
Ello ello ello hello white America assassinate my character
Money matrimony yeah they tryna break the marriage up
Who gon act phony or who gone try to embarrass ya
Imma need a day off I think Ill call Ferris up
Bueller had a Muller but I switched it for a Mille
Cause Im richer and prior to this shit was moving free base
Had a conference with the DJs Puerto Rico three days
Poli with the PDs now they got our shit on replay
Sorry Im in pajamas but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had they shut down Prive
Aint that where the Heat play Niggas hate ballas these days Yep
Aint that like Lebron James Aint that just like D Wade Wait
On a bathroom wall I wrote
Id rather argue with you than be with someone else
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo Id rather be by my fucking self
Till about two am and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help
You werent perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you aint getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin you
Lying say I hit you he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud whos provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
AM and cant nobody get a hold of you
Im calling your brothers phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That aint right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I aint your right girl
Youll probably find one of them I like arttype girls
All of the lights shewascaughtinthehype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame you to blame me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game
Things used to be now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
Weve become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of LOVE
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely Chloe Mitchell
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing the whole thing the whole thing
You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit thats the tea no sip
Dont trip dont trip that pussy slippery no whip
We aint trippin on shit we just sippin on this
Just forget the whole shit we could laugh about nothin
I impregnate your mind lets have a baby without fuckin yo
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know its corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know its corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin
Thuggin hustlin before you met your husband
Then I said What if Mary was in the club
Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs
Cover Nori in lambs wool
We surrounded by the fuckin wolves
What if Mary What if Mary
Was in the club was in the club
Fore she met Joseph with no love
Cover Saint in lambs wool
And she was We surrounded by
Surrounded by the fuckin wolves
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I cant jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
Im the only one thats in control
I been feeling all Ive given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God Im willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
See before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You aint never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times just to say dont text me hoe
Told you four times dont test me hoe
Now we finna lose all selfcontrol
But you aint finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But Imma have the last laugh in the end
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah Imma have to laugh Indian
Cause Im from a tribe called check a hoe
And I
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I dont know what it is with females
But Im not too good with that shit
See I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know thats what Im good at
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I dont know how Imma manage
If one day you just up and leave
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God Id be back in a second
Man its so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure under more scrutiny
And what I do act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry more Louis V
My Momma couldnt get through to me
The drama people suing me
Im on TV talking like its just you and me
Im just saying how I feel man
I aint one of the Cosbys I aint go to Hillman
I guess the money shouldve changed him
I guess I shouldve forgot where I came from
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldnt tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day
Class started hours ago oh am I late
No I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Dont ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon end up apologing
Let me know if its a problem then aight man holla then
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He dont even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of nos
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes
Must be the pharaohs he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure whats your pleasure
Life is a UH depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada Adam Eve wear nada
Im in between but way more fresher
With way less effort cause when you try hard
Thats when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you my God

Step up in this bitch like turn me up
Im the one your bitch like
Yeah Im the one your bitch like
And I be talkin shit like
I aint scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin on my dick like
She wanna see if itll fit right
Thats just the wave
Sun dont shine in the shade turn me up
Bird cant fly in a cage turn me up
Even when somebody go away turn me up
The feelings dont really go away
Thats just the wave yeah
I fantasized bout this back in Chicago
Mercy mercy me that Murcielago
Thats me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You aint got no fuckin Yeezy in your Serato
You aint got no Yeezy nigga
Stupid but what the hell do I know
Im just a Chitown nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head I woke up to Sleepy Hollow
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire Im the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest hey teacher teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students
And refresh the page and restart the memory
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy
We stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But whats worse the pain or the hangover
Fresh air rollin down the window
Too many Urkels on your team thats why your wins low
Dont make me pull the toys out huh
Dont make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines huh
And then they make noise
Penitentiary chances the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin for the love of ballin
Got caught with rocks the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that its random
But we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
This the real world homie school finished
They done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as Im in Polo smiling they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldnt sack me
If a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the Worlds game this is my Olympics
We make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs niggas cant resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasnt the greatest nigga I must have missed it
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said take them glasses off and get in the pool 
Its been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I dont believe in yesterday
And whats a black Beatle anyway a fucking roach
I guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like Im sniffing coke
Its not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell em hug and kiss my ass x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I aint had a belt in two classes
I aint got it Im coming after whoever who has it
Im coming after whoever Who has it
You blowin up thats good fantastic
That yall its like that yall
I dont really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things my black balls
Cutie the bomb met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm
But Im looking for the one have you seen her
My psychic told me shell have a ass like Serena
Trina Jennifer Lopez four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to showbiz
Okay get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz they all got up in
We all went to din and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid
You know why It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she used to fuck with Usher
I dont care what none of yall say I still love her
May the Lord forgive us may the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians
Make rash decisions oh she do it
What happened to religion Oh she lose it
She putting on her make up she casually allure
Text message break ups the casualty of tour
How she gon wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the asshole I guess its rubbing off
Hood phenomenon the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
Im looking at her like this what you really wanted huh
Why we argue anyway Oh I forgot its summertime
When the sun go down its the magic hour
And outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up
Dont leave while youre hot thats how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar take a seat
I ordered the jerk she said you are what you eat
You see I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme

You love me for me Could you be more phony
Damn Yeezy and Hov where the hell ya been
Niggas talking real reckless stuntmen

The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us

Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed
She dont believe in shooting stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the stores departments
You more like love to start shit
Im more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors doeuvres views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why cant life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like Where are you Yeezy
And try to hit you with the olwuwopte
Til I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazi
I know its been a while sweetheart
We hardly talk I was doing my thang
I know it was foul baby
Aye babe lately youve been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Fronting though yo I wouldnt wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
Itll go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past you on the other side of the glass
Of my memorys museum
Im just saying hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you cant roam without Caesar
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the rednosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain my seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Aint nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin all the good beats for himself
RocAFellas only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Pauls goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air here
They say he bougie he bigheaded
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious give me seconds
Ill have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
Its funny how wasnt nobody interested
Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus
Now was Kanye the most overlooked Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Thatll take Freeway throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwali or Kweli I put him on songs with JayZ
Im the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as BunB when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous now everybody love Kanye
Im almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant Can yall blame him
It was straight embarrassing how yall played him
Last year shoppin my demo I was tryin to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldnt rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my selfesteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas so they say that Im gassed
But without it Id be last so I ought to laugh
So I dont listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits cause you cant dress no more
You cant say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked people I was just on tour nigga
Im Kan the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I aint play the hand I was dealt I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
Oh my god is that a black card
I turned around and replied Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express
Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle you know what Ive been up to
Killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaisecolored Benz I push Miracle Whips
I met this girl when I was years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said Excuse me lil homie I know you dont know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tow em off
And make em straighten up their hat
Cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
I told her in my heart is where shell always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said It felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye keep making that keep making that
Keep making that platinum and gold for me
But if you really cared for her then you wouldnt have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking bout me
She said You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you and I just got through
Talking bout what we tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got til its gone
I guess thats why Im here and I cant come back home
And guess when I heard that When I was back home
Every interview Im representin you makin you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
If you dont know by now Im talking bout ChiTown
It was all good just a week ago niggas feel theyselves
And that Watch the Throne drop niggas kill themselves
What niggas gon do Hov
This a new crack on a new stove
Im in the twodoor true that niggas telling me You back
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch huh
And if lifes a bitch bet she suck my dick huh
And I bet she fucked the whole clique huh
By the way nigga you should fucking quit nigga
Just forget it you talk it I live it
Like Eli I did it jokes on you motherfucker and I get it
No paper ho but you can have some more of me
Oragy or are we speaking metaphorically
Historically Im kicking bitches out like Pam nigga
Going H¬¨‚àëA¬¨‚àëM nigga
Me and Jigga
And a nigga still young thats why I have no kids
But Ive been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
Had a few white girls asses flat as shit
But the heads so good damn a nigga glad he hit
Got em jumping out the building watch out below
A million out the door Im about to go H¬¨‚àëA¬¨‚àëM
I treat the label like money from my shows
GOOD woulda been God except I added more Os
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
Its cause I was too busy with my Baltimore you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you falling for the clothes
Cars money girls and the clothes
Aw money you sold your soul
Nah man mad people was fronting
Goddamn we made something from nothing
Youre my devil youre my angel
Youre my heaven youre my hell
Youre my now youre my forever
Youre my freedom youre my jail
Youre my lies youre my truth
Youre my war youre my truce
Youre my questions youre my proof
Youre my stress and youre my masseuse
Ma ma se ma ma se ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life
Lets break out of this fakeass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each others arms still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each others arms still get laid yeah yeah yeah
My wife said I cant say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin Im in debt
And like my wife said I still didnt say no
People tryna say Im goin crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin
The media said hes way out of control
I just feel like Im the only one not pretendin
Im not out of control Im just not in they control
I know Im the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generations closest thing to Einstein
So dont worry about me Im fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought dont need to question
I know its antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra he down with the mission
Did it with with no permission on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Dont stare at money too long its Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasnt supposed to make it past
Ive been wakin the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children listen to the kids bro
If the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
But buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
The light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
I am one with the people
I am one with the people real
Ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
Checkin Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if Im up way too much Im out of touch
Im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
So the people can see my light now its not just rappin
God I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know I know he got a plan I know Im on your beams
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin me
One set of footsteps you was carryin me
When I was negotiatin with Apple it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me I was scary to see
I wouldve took a hundred million and gave to Hov
I heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
But its better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then Ima never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time Im on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself lookin for niggas like wheres Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with a off the wall flow
Closed eyes see things

Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton

You know what the Midwest is Young and restless
Where restless niggas might snatch your necklace

Somebody tell these niggas who Kanye West is

Getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method

Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause were the almost nearly extinct

Or here to convert atheists into believers
Im just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis thats the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns sex lies videotape
But if I talk about God my record wont get played huh
Well if this take away from my spins
Whichll probably take away from my ends

And bring the day that Im dreamin about
Next time Im in the club everybody screamin out
Wake up Mr West Mr West
Mr Fresh Mister by himself hes so impressed
I mean damn did you even see the test

Homie this shit is basic welcome to Graduation
Good morning on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
Im like the fly Malcolm X buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league from a eighth to a ki
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed now you doing your thang
Good morning look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world complacent career student
Some people graduate but be still stupid
They tell you read this eat this dont look around
Just peep this preachers teach us Jesus
Okay look up now they done stoled yo streetness
After all of that you received this
Im the one baby yeah Im the one baby
Since God gave his only begotten son baby
Its hard preachin the gospel to the slums lately

You on a run baby you on a run baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds baby
You think you me but you aint me what you done lately
Mhm thats cool but I been runnin on the sun baby
We on a galaxy the haters cannot visit
Thats my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
Tyson Jackson Jordan Michael Phelps
Yeahhh had to take it to another realm
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip Yeeeaaaalmmp
Welcome to the good life where niggas who sell D
Wont even get pulled over in they new V
The good life lets go on a living spree
Shit they say the best things in life are free
The good life it feel like Atlanta
It feel like LA it feel like Miami
It feel like NY summertime Chi
Ah Now throw yo hands up in the sky
So I roll through good
Yall pop the trunk I pop the hood Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass I got to look sorry
Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who aint on TV
Cause they got mo ass than the models

It feel like VA or the Bay or Yay
Ay this is the good life Welcome to the good life
Homey tell me whats good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood Welcome to the good life

The only thing I wish I wish a nigga would Welcome to the good life
He probably think he could
But but I dont think he should Welcome to the good life
told me go head switch the style up
And if they hate then let em hate and watch the money pile up
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane while gettin some brain
Whipped it out she said I never seen Snakes on a Plane
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin moneys not everything not havin it is
I was splurgin on Tryst but when I get my card back
Activated Im back to Vegas
Cause the good life I always had a passion for flashin
Befo I had it I closed my eyes and imagined the good life
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boys street team I couldnt work the locks
Now lets go take em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that UHaul van
Any pessimists I aint talk to them
Plus I aint have no phone in my apartament
Lets take em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line Dawg in due time
Now he look at me like Damn dawg You where I am
A hiphop legend
I think I died in that accident cause this must be Heaven
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
Id do anything to say I got it
Damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog I was having nervous breakdowns
Like Man these niggas that much better than me
Baby Im going on an aeroplane
And I dont know if Ill be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it things became different
Any girl I cheated on sheets I skeeted on
Couldnt keep it at home thought I needed a Nia Long
Im trying to right my wrongs
But its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song
Close your eyes and imagine feel the magic
Vegas on acid seen through Yves St Laurent glasses
And Ive realized that Ive arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes well sort of I think em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn is he really that caught up
I ask if you talked about classics do my name get brought up
I remember I couldnt afford a Ford Escort
Or even a fourtrack recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a droptop Porsche
Its for yourself thats important
If your stripper name Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me thats just the Henny man
I smoke I drink Im supposed to stop I cant because
I was sick about awards couldnt nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
minutes later sein theres no convincin him
What more could you ask for The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed
And throw a tantrum like he is years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldnt change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is yall to pronounce my name
Its Kanye but some of my plaques they still say Kayne
Got family in the D Kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi them Folks aint from Moe Town
Life movin too fast I need to slow down
Girl aint give me no ass ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call you got a message then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw em up like you bulimic
Yeah the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit it sound like the best of
ARs lookin like Pssh we messed up
Grammy night damn right we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe yeah he next up
People askin me if Im gon give my chain back
Thatll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog Yo where Dame at
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
Whats up with you and Jay man are yall ok man
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
Rrrrright here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
I get down for my grandfather who took my mama
Made her sit in that seat where white folks aint want us to eat
At the tender age of she was arrested for the sitins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacobs and to the dealership
Swear I hear new music and I just dont be feelin it
Racisms still alive they just be concealin it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams Club
I done did dirt and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
Swear Ive been baptized least or times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
Its gonna take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than doo rags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girls father passed away
So I promised to Mr Rainey Im gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see the car I bought her
You sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I cant complain what the accident did to my left eye
Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side
Its the Hard Knock Life Tour sellout picture
Us in the mall coppin Iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yeah thats what well yell out yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout
JAY and Ye so shy
Now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind He could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline
Nothing handed out Im bout to take mine
round the same time of that Blueprint
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Hed bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
But by The Black Album I was blacking out
Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the Presidito hola Hovito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steeple
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one Imma beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pickandroll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Translate espanol No way Jose
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
And Ill never let my son have an ego
Hell be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And Ill never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And Ill never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyin and the world ends
See I just want him to have an easy life
Not like Yeezy life just want him to be someone people like
Dont want him to be hated all the time judged
Dont be like your daddy that would never budge
And Ill never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way that aint the place to get love
And Ill never let his mom move to LA
Knowin she couldnt take the pressure now we all pray
I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache
Make her knees shake make a priest faint
Make a nun cum make her cremate
Move downtown cop a sweet space
Livin life like we won the sweepstakes what
We headed to hell for heavens sakes huh
Well Imma levitate make the devil wait yeah
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin from inside the screen you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal or do a gangbang
Its kinda crazy thats all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang bang bang bang bang
One day Im gon marry a porn star
Well have a bigass crib and a long yard
Well have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin to hide we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna role play til I roll over
Imma need a whole day at least rolled doja
What party is we goin to on Oscar day
specially if she cant get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta they wouldnt rent her they couldnt take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her Get away 
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck with the lights on
Mmm aint this some shit Pulled up in the AVentador
And the doors raise up like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show and a tour and a movie and a score
This a ghetto opera Francis Foreign Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques Rick Rossd told me that
Said Id be all up in Goldman Sachs like These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back Im just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney dont pay no tax Mitt Romney dont pay no tax
ChiTown til Im on my back ChiTown til Im on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills where the hell is Axel Foley at
Ease up there baby boy Ving Rhames told Jody that
R Kelly and the God of rap
Shitting on you holy crap
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and Im finna let it shine
Im finna take yall back to them better times
Im finna talk about my mama if yall dont mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup can I have another bowl
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove but didnt give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see
Seven years old caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin telling you lies then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you dont hurt no more
And when Im older you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldnt afford
See youre unbreakable unmistakable
Highly capable lady thats makin loot
A livin legend too just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel and I thank you Hey Mama
Forrest Gump mama said Life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like its things I gotta get
Things I gotta do just to prove to you
You was getting through can the choir please
Give me a verse of You Are So Beautiful To Me
Cant you see youre like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou Nikki Giovanni turn one page and theres my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey yall say Mama now everybody answer me Hey Mama
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world let me take you out
To a restaurant upper echelon
Imma get you a Jag whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of SType Donda West like
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It dont gotta be Mothers Day or your birthday
For me to just call and say Hey Mama
And I heard em say nothings ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi like Tim its a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage
And I know that the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
All∆í√Öhu Akbar and throw him some hot cars
Things we see on the screen thats not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where Im from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they cant cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars I know it
They say people in your life for seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus and one day that you see him
Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claiming money is the key so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam cant put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now
I cant figure it out Im sick of it now
Trying to sneak upstairs to your apartment
Arent you a sight for red eyes
I just flew in and slipped in on your left side
Just a satin gown you asleep with no makeup
Im just tryna be inside you fore you wake up
We had problems but its all in the past
Everybody got problems baby algebra class
Remember I used to do things thatd make you laugh
Like orderin a girl drink in a masculine glass
You like pi‚àö¬±a coladas getting caught in the rain
Or rocking flannels all summer like Kurt Cobain
Or that Dolce Gabbana with a few gold chains
And you the type of girl that probably deserve a new last name
But they never let us do our thing
Everybody lying on who I bang
We was on fire but they blew our flame
Aint no denying baby you have changed
Cause now your high heels clicking your lip gloss glisten
Your hips start switching youre pissed off tripping
Cause even when were kissing baby girl feel different
Friends all diss him like No he didnt
No he didnt is you talking about Kitten
Is that bitch still stripping
Trying to get a pair of Christians
I swear to God that they got you going crazy
But you play it off and say How is work baby
Well some of the models is too coked up to walk straight
But seem to still love the man that they all hate
But babe I call you back and say that you say that always
And kept me on the phone and demanded they all wait
See she knew about all my lies the whole time
And my credits so bad I cant get no one to cosign
I wouldve thought she wouldve bust in the door cryin
But she upped and left a nigga and she aint give me no sign
Now she back in the club in a tight dress
With dreams of someday wearing a white dress
Seen with some lame its a miracle that shed
Talk to a nigga with a tenyear ago swag
Plus I dont like none of her girlfriends
Quote unquote Cause her girlfriends got girlfriends
On the phone hollin that niggas is whatever
Lets fly to Euro and make this the best summer ever
Now she heading to Rome Rome is the home
Rome is where she act like she aint got no fucking phone
I accept that I was wrong except a nigga grown
So I cant bitch and moan in a session gettin stoned
So a nigga had to hop on a plane
A bus and a train to try to come and talk and explain
Rented the whole bottom floor for a candlelight dinner
Turned the lights out and put my candle right in her
And told her Even though I met you in a club in a tight dress
At first sight I could picture you in a white dress
Thirty foot train diamond from Lorraine
Just to make up for all the years and the pain
Family on both sides Im so glad you came
Aunty couldnt make it oh no thats a shame
Wedding in June what could be better
Lets fly to Euro make this the best summer ever
Take the very last car of the Eurostar
Tell the conductor Just drive so far
Told some of your friends and they wasnt excited
Well we gon tour the countryside and they wont be invited
We will not be disturbed by the fussin and fighting
Tell Peaches light the herb cause we just reunited
Lets make a move from these herbs go somewhere in private
Im talking just me and you and the plane and the pilot
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo I know of some things that you aint told me
Ayo I did some things but thats the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gonna show me
So you walk around like you dont know me
You got a new friend well I got homies
But in the end its still so lonely
How could you be so Dr Evil
You bringing out a side of me that I dont know
I decided we wasnt gonna speak so
Why we up AM on the phone
Why do she be so mad at me for
Homie I dont know shes hot and cold
I wont stop wont mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that youre leavin me
They say that they dont see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months then you gonna see
Youll never find nobody better than me
You dont see just how wild the crowd is realize
You dont see just how fly my style is realize
I dont see why I need a stylist realize
When I shop so much I can speak Italian realize
I dont know I just want it better for my kids realize
And I aint saying we was from the projects realize
But every time I wanna layaway or deposit realize
My dadd say when you see clothes close your eyelids realize
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son realize
In the movie I aint talking bout the rich ones realize
Cause every summer
Hell get some brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from realize
And I dont know what he did for dough realize
But hell send me back to school with a new wardrobe
When it feel like livings harder than dying realize
For me giving ups way harder than trying realize
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion realize
I wish her heart still was in rhyming realize
Cause who the kids gon listen to huh realize
I guess me if it isnt you realize
Last week I paid a visit to the institute realize
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school realize
I guess I cleaned up my act like Princed do realize
If not for pleasure then at least for the principle realize
They got the CD they got to see me realize
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE realize
They used to feel invisible realize
Now they know they invincible
I paid for them titties get your own
It aint safe in the city watch the throne
She say I care more about them basquions
Basquiats she learning a new word its yacht
Blew the world up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called told me I fell in love with her
Seat by actors ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
Im a freak huh rock star life
The second girl with us thats our wife
Hey boys and girls I got a new riddle
Whos the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
No disrespect Im not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle
Where she at In the middle
Ill never be pictureperfect Beyonc‚àö¬©
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet He was as black as the street was
Ill never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fakeass facade that they couldnt keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
Ill never rock a mink coat in the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like WillIAm
Let me know if you feel it man
Cause everything Im not made me everything I am
And Im back to tear it up
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Ok fair enough the streets is flaring up
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the NAACP award
Goodbye to the India Arie award
Theyd rather give me the Nigga Please Award
But Ill just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award
I know that people wouldnt usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind

You could help me ease my mind

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
[Clean version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[Explicit version:] Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me) But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat. Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us
And a million miles Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Anymore Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to? Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cry
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name When laying with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here, forever
You and me together, nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die, 'cause I knew that
That was the last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you
Even now when it's already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Let it burn while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, oh
Oh, oh Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care? It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if, it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before,
Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again? She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core

Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want I don't know why I'm scared
I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts If I've been on your mind
You hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose, you'll go? I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy, mm
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

To prove that I am the one who can, walk that mile
Until the end starts If you're not the one for me
Then I'll come back and bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh when you found that the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam.
I ain't lost, just wandering" Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables Under haunted skies I see
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, turning tables Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls to me
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables, to turning tables
Turning tables, yeah, turning This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall Just the guitar This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me, umm

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I, I miss my baby Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
In your heart I bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
Harder baby (harder baby), harder baby I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be
Your remedy, oh Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love Maybe I should leave, to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over? Is this really it, you're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do, is for you But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all, with my love
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
But I want you to be true
And I just want to make love to you
Love to you, ooh baby
Love to you, yeah All I want to do is wash your clothes
I don't want to keep you indoors
There is nothing you can't do
But keep me making love to me
Love to me, ooh baby

And I can hear by the way you talk that talk
And I can know by the way you treat your girl

Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head Lay down with me
And tell me no lies
Just hold me closly
Don't patronize Don't patronize me 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't
And even in the dark
These final hours
I will lay down my heart
I will feel the power
But you won't
No, you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't, yeah I'll close my eyes
'Cause then I don't see
The love you don't feel
When you're holding me Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight And I will give up this fight 'Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Something that it won't

You, when you don't, yeah, yeah Hold me closer, one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me, for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face, under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart, more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better for you This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall
at sky fall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me with out the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand.... Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall (Verse 1)
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark Chorus 1
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all... (You're gonna wish you never met me)
Rolling in the deep... (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin' in the deep) Verse 2
Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared (Chorus 2)
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling, we could've had it all
Rolling in the deep... you had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all... Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating (Verse 3)
Throw your stone through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3)
We could've had it all... We could've had it all...
It all, It all, It all... We could've had it all...
Rollin' in the deep...
You had my heart inside of your hand
And you played it to the beat
Could've had it all
Rollin' in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I'll be better without you,
They don't know you like I do,
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
I can't bear this time,
It drags, as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind.
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity is become undone But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,
If this is ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
But nothing will never taint us I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait
I'll be home soon, I won't be late He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion [Verse 1]
When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Verse 2]
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]
I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Bridge]
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms [Chorus]
Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go [Outro]
Hope you know, I won't let go I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.
So stand beside the river you cried
And lay yourself down!
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why, don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be alive
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall [x2:]
(Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall) Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At skyfall Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
It blew me away
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of your head
Watch you wave
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That I call home
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And though I wish that you were here
On that same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you
When the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known
You disappear one day
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the things
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye Oh
I still care
Fool that I am
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]
Why do you love me
Do you love me...?
Why do you love me
Do you love me?
Why do you love me
Do you love me? Why do you love me...? Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me? Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breath
Whatever it is, I depend on it
Where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right It's above and beyond me
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy
It's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me You were a shock in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you It's above and beyond me,
It's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me... Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me? You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other a year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You think we would and we do,
But we do, but we do, but we do Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad Favoritism ain't my thing but,
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception You said I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say I've known you longer my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other,
Think we'll never match at all, but we do In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't wait to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
Make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left
I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own
You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you
It's taken all of my stake
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time
Let the weight take me under
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn [Adele]
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...
Every part of me
All my words to hold
And hold against me
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down
'til the morning!
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) I would never break the rules unless you tell me to
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down (Someone believe me) Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)
Lay me down
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry
Didn`t show emotions, don`t know why
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside, I guess But as the years keep going by,
you came along and changed my mind
I should leave the past behind me,
I should let you find me,
supposed to stay beside me
You were supposed to guide me,
through the ups and downs,
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could
`cause you and me, we`re good
And I`ll tell you why this hurts, 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink
whenever I start to think about you
`cause I do but I really don`t want to
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,
to a place where I see you in a kitchen
I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,
I don`t really wanna see you
and I don`t want you to see me,
you would think that I was crazy,
you might think that I wanna be close to you
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky
and maybe have a little sip `o wine
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could
(I`m not drunk enough)
`cause you and me, we`re good
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough (I still think we could)
But I just wanna be drunk
so I can forget about you
and all the stupid things that love has put me through
(`cause you and me we`re good)
Even when I've had too much,
I still feel your touch
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough
I must my way
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind
You're leading me astray
You haunt me like a ghost
And that scares me the most
There you are the devil on my shoulder
Smiling as the flames are growing colder
How can I believer what I have?
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own
I fell it in my bones any minute now!
This train of thought will leave the statio
My impatience will come out to play
You've turned out to be the only face I see!
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room
You spin a web in every room
And try to break the backbone that I've grown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus]
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on [Chorus] Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears I told you
That we could fly
'Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart
I see your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find
So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me alright
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want There will be times
When we'll try to give it up
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the star
You know I'm never gonna leave you
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave you
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year [Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there's many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black Go ahead... Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, baby
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door Well, I've been in town
For just about fifteen
Whole minutes now
Oh, baby, I feel so down
And I don't know why
I keep walking for miles But the people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They can't understand
Your grandsons
They won't understand
On top of this
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
Don't feel so down
Oh, and turned me off
When I feel left out
So I, I turned around
Oh, baby
I'm gonna be alright
It was a great big lie
Cuz I left that night
Yeah Oh, people
They don't understand
No, girlfriends
They don't understand
In spaceships
They won't understand
And me
I ain't ever
Gonna understand Last night she said
Oh, baby
I feel so down
She had turned me off
When I feel left out
So I
I turned around
Oh, little girl
I don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking
Out that door, yeah Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest 'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here Find yourself a girl
And settle down
Live a simple life
In a quiet town Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
Steady as she goes

A kink
In the single life
You've had
Too much to think

As though you
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes When you have completed
What you thought
You had to do
And your blood's
Depleted
To the point
Of stable glue Then you'll get along
Then you'll get along Steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes)
So steady as she goes
(Steady as she goes) Well here we go again
You've found yourself
A friend
That knows you well
But no matter
What you do
You'll always feel
As though you
Tripped and fell So steady as she goes
Steady as she goes Settle for a girl

Sell it to the crowd

Neither up or down

Sell it to the crowd
